# Chord Visualizer Mobile Migration Roadmap

**Date:** 2025-09-24

## Current State Analysis

**Web Application Features:**
- Complete interactive chord visualization system
- Circle of fifths interface
- Multi-instrument fretboard visualization (guitar, bass, ukulele, violin)
- Custom tuning controls
- Multiple scale modes (major, minor, pentatonic, whole tone, etc.)
- Chord progression composer with staff notation
- Audio synthesis and playback
- Position-based fretboard zooming
- Custom chord building interface
- Real-time chord analysis and suggestions
- Arpeggio visualization with SVG lines
- Roman numeral analysis
- Cadence suggestions

**React Native App Current State:**
- Only contains placeholder comments
- No actual components implemented
- No functionality present
- Essentially a blank template

## Missing Components and Features

### 1. Core UI Components
- Circle of Fifths: Interactive circular key selector
- Instrument Selector: Multi-instrument support with switching
- Fretboard Grid: Complex CSS Grid layout for fretboard visualization
- Staff Notation: Musical staff with measure-based chord display
- Tuning Controls: String-by-string tuning adjustment
- Position Controls: Roman numeral position buttons with zoom functionality

### 2. Interactive Features
- Note Selection: Touch-based note selection for chord building
- Chord Recognition: Real-time analysis of selected notes
- Audio Playback: Web Audio API equivalent for mobile
- Progression Playback: Metronome with chord sequence playback
- Zoom Controls: Position-based fretboard focusing
- Custom Chord Builder: Multi-touch chord construction

### 3. Data Management
- Musical Theory Engine: Scale generation, chord analysis
- State Management: Complex app state for progressions, selections
- Audio Context: Mobile audio synthesis system
- Chord Templates: Pattern matching system for chord recognition

### 4. Mobile-Specific Adaptations Needed
- Touch Interactions: Convert click events to touch events
- Responsive Layout: Mobile-optimized layouts
- Audio Permissions: Mobile audio system setup
- Performance Optimization: Efficient rendering for mobile

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Setup
1. Set up proper React Native project structure
2. Implement state management system (Context/Redux)
3. Create base component hierarchy
4. Set up mobile audio system (react-native-sound or expo-audio)

### Phase 2: Music Theory Engine
1. Port musical data structures (keys, scales, chord templates)
2. Implement scale generation algorithms
3. Create chord recognition system
4. Build note/frequency conversion utilities

### Phase 3: Basic UI Components
1. Circle of Fifths component (using react-native-svg)
2. Instrument selector with switching logic
3. Basic fretboard grid layout
4. Key information display panel

### Phase 4: Interactive Fretboard
1. Touch-responsive fretboard grid
2. Note visualization with color coding
3. Custom chord building interface
4. Position controls and zoom functionality

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
1. Staff notation system (using react-native-svg)
2. Chord progression composer
3. Audio synthesis and playback
4. Arpeggio line visualization

### Phase 6: Mobile Optimization
1. Responsive design for different screen sizes
2. Touch gesture optimization
3. Performance tuning
4. Platform-specific adaptations (iOS/Android)

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. CSS Grid to Flexbox/Native Layout
- Web app uses complex CSS Grid for fretboard
- React Native requires Flexbox or custom positioning
- Need to recreate precise grid alignment

### 2. SVG Integration
- Web app uses inline SVG for arpeggio lines and staff notation
- React Native needs react-native-svg library
- Complex path calculations need to be preserved

### 3. Audio System
- Web Audio API needs mobile equivalent
- Touch-to-unlock audio requirements
- Background audio considerations

### 4. Touch Interactions
- Convert mouse events to touch events
- Handle multi-touch for chord building
- Implement proper touch feedback

### 5. State Complexity
- Web app has complex interdependent state
- Need robust state management for mobile
- Preserve all musical logic and relationships

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

1. Start with core music theory engine - This is platform-agnostic
2. Build basic UI incrementally - Start simple, add complexity gradually
3. Focus on mobile UX patterns - Don't just port, optimize for touch
4. Implement audio last - Most complex and platform-specific
5. Test extensively on both platforms - iOS and Android have different behaviors

---

**Summary:**
The gap between the current React Native app and the web application is substantial - essentially a complete rebuild is needed. The web app represents several months of development work with complex musical theory implementation, advanced UI interactions, and sophisticated audio handling that all needs to be recreated for mobile.
