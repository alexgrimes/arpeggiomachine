# Chord Visualizer II - Migration & Feature Checklist

## Core Technical Components

1. Circle of Fifths Visualization
   - [ ] SVG-based, 24 keys, concentric circles, color-coded, interactive
2. Multi-Instrument Fretboard System
   - [ ] Guitar, Bass, Ukulele, Violin
   - [ ] Tuning controls, note highlighting, chord building
3. Advanced Music Theory Engine
   - [ ] 11+ scale types, diatonic/secondary/extended chords, enharmonic logic
4. Smart Chord Recognition System
   - [ ] 40+ chord templates, interval analysis, root selection, slash chords
5. Interactive Staff Notation System
   - [ ] SVG staff, multi-row, measure selection, Roman numerals, beat indication
6. Position-Based Fretboard Zoom
   - [ ] 17 positions, opacity, highlight, arpeggio lines, animation
7. Audio Synthesis Engine
   - [ ] Native audio, multi-voice, metronome, count-in, mobile unlock
8. Chord Progression Composer
   - [ ] Staff integration, tempo, looping, visual beat, measure highlight, cadence suggestions, auto-advance, custom chord integration
9. Custom Chord Builder
   - [ ] Interactive, root selection, real-time analysis, progression integration

## Key Data Structures
- [ ] musicalKeys (24 keys, scale/chord data)
- [ ] scaleFormulas (11+ types)
- [ ] CHORD_TEMPLATES (40+ types)
- [ ] instruments (4 types, tunings)

## State Management
- [ ] selectedKey, selectedScale, selectedInstrument, chordMode, customChordNotes, progressionMeasures, isPositionZoomed, audioContext, isPlaying, isMobileAudioUnlocked

## Migration Priorities
- [ ] Fretboard Grid System (FlatList/custom grid)
- [ ] Audio Engine (native audio)
- [ ] Circle of Fifths (SVG)
- [ ] Touch Interactions (TouchableOpacity)
- [ ] Staff Notation (SVG)
- [ ] Position Zoom (ScrollView)
- [ ] Chord Recognition (logic port)

## Technical Challenges
- [ ] CSS Grid → Flexbox
- [ ] Web Audio API → native audio
- [ ] SVG Animations (arpeggio lines)
- [ ] Complex Positioning (Flexbox)
- [ ] Font Loading (music notation)

## Libraries
- [ ] react-native-svg
- [ ] @react-native-community/audio-toolkit
- [ ] react-native-super-grid
- [ ] react-native-gesture-handler
- [ ] react-native-reanimated
- [ ] expo-font

## Outstanding Features (to implement next)
- [ ] Staff Notation UI (multi-row, measure selection, Roman numerals, beat indication)
- [ ] Metronome Audio (click track, count-in, tempo sync)
- [ ] Chord Diagram/Voicing Modal (guitar, piano, ukulele, violin)
- [ ] Progression Save/Load UI (naming, list, import/export)
- [ ] Key Transposition UI (shift keys/progressions)
- [ ] Fretboard Zoom & SVG Animations (arpeggio lines, transitions)
- [ ] Font Loading for Notation (if needed)
